# Drumpfinator

This is a simple chrome extension to replace all instances of "Trump" with the word "Drumpf"

some reviews: 

> Before the Drumpfinator, I thought about unfollowing my Ã¼ber-Conservative cousins who enjoy espousing the wonders and joys of "The Donald." After the Drumpfinator, I can enjoy their Facebook idiocy once again. Instead of scowling and spending hours typing facts and figures they ignore with wild abandon, I now have a good chuckle and move on with my day. Thanks, Drumpfinator!

> I loved the idea of the extension that removes all instances of Donald from the internet, but I still wanted fuel to use against his supporters. Now I can disrespect him and still know what he's up to! Thanks, Nitin!

(PS: ~~these reviews are totally real~~)
